## How to install a website

Installing is unzipping one file and you are ready to go. First the installer checks whether all requirements have been met, for example whether your web server is working properly. Then the installer offers you to create a user account and helps you with setting up your website. Select what you want to do and click `Install`. After the installer has done its work it will delete itself. [Learn more about installation](https://datenstrom.se/yellow/help/how-to-get-started).

## How to make a translation

Start with the [English language file](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-language/blob/main/translations/english/english.php) or one of the [available translations](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-language/tree/main/translations). This will show you which text lines and text fragments are included in a language. The installed languages are stored in your `system/extensions` folder. Sometimes they contain text lines in English, which have not been translated. That's why it's good to check from time to time that everything looks okay. Upload your translation to GitHub, let us know if you need help.
