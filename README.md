## How to make a translation

Start with the [English language file](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-language/blob/main/translation/english/english.txt) or one of the [available languages](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions#languages). This will show you which text lines and text fragments are included in a language. All language files are stored in your `system/extensions` folder. Sometimes they contain text lines in English, which have not been translated. That's why it's good to check from time to time that everything looks okay. Upload your changes to GitHub, let us know if you need help.
