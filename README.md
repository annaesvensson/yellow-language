## How to install an extension

[Download ZIP file](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-language/raw/main/downloads/english.zip) and copy it into your `system/extensions` folder. [Learn more about extensions](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-update).

## How to make a translation

Start with the [English language file](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-language/blob/main/translations/english/english.php) or one of the [available languages](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-language/tree/main/translations). This will show you which text lines and text fragments are included in a language. It is enough if you translate the English language file and put it into a new folder. A maintainer can take care of everything else. Did you make a translation? Fork this repository. Upload your changes to GitHub and create a pull request for the repository `annaesvensson/yellow-language`.

## How to improve a translation

You can improve a translation if something is wrong. The installed languages are stored in your `system/workers` folder. Sometimes they contain text lines in English, which have not been translated. That's why it's good to check from time to time that everything looks okay. Did you improve a translation? Fork this repository.
